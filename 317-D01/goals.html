<p style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">General
Goals:</span><br>
<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">1.
Gaining factual knowledge and skills in writing mathematical proofs (terminology and methods)</span><br style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">2.
Learning to apply course material (problem solving and </span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">writing mathematical proofs</span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">) <br>
Math majors are so popular with employers because of their logical thinking skills. A proof is the <br>
ultimate test of that logical thinking ability.</span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p>


<p style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Subject
Goals:</span>
<br>
<strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">1. To learn theory and
methods of Real Analysis <br>
2. To develop skills in writing proofs of results in calculus and real
analysis based on available definitions and terminology  </span><span style="font-weight: normal;"></span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;">3.
To develop skills in
solving problems of Real Analysis related to uniform and pointwise
convergence and using rigorous definition <br>
of limits in various contexts of sequences, functions, and sequences of functions. </span></strong><br>
<span style="font-weight: normal;">4. To develop understanding of continuity versus uniform continuity. <br>
</span></p>

<p style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Writing in the Disciplines (WID) Goals<br>
<span style="font-weight: normal;">1. To focus on writing as a product. <br>
2. To learn how to write in the manner accepted in Mathematics research community, learning conventions of <br>
writing and the rationale behind them. <br>
3. To have substantive and direct instruction in the writing process, in addition to mathematical content.<br>
4. To receive formative feedback from the instructor on the high-stake draft in progress as well as evaluation of final draft.<br>
Feedback is designed to help you to prioritize what areas need revision to improve your final draft. </span></p></body></html>
